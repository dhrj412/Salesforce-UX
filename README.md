## Tasks Manager

Displays active system time and a greeting based on the time.
User can add tasks using the input box and clicking the add icon.
Tasks will automatically get added under Upcoming section, after completing the task user can click on the completed checkbox which will move the task to Completed section.
User can also delete tasks using the delete icon.

## Inventory

User can search through the inventory with any column value (not case sensitve), select number of items to display and navigate through pages.

## Recommondation strip

Displays 6 random car details which are available in inventory.
Recommondations refresh every 1 minute with new car details.
I chose to randomise the recommondations as I want them to be independent of homogeneous data.
